# quick_blue_linux

The Linux BlueZ implementation of the `quick_blue` federated Flutter plugin.

Follow the main package's
[Git installation instructions](https://github.com/prefanatic/quick_blue/blob/master/quick_blue/README.md#install)
to use this implementation from the fork.

See the [QuickBlue repository](https://github.com/prefanatic/quick_blue) for
usage, platform setup, and development documentation.

## Requirements

- A running BlueZ daemon and a working BLE adapter.
- A D-Bus system-bus policy that lets the application user own names under
  `dev.quick_blue.Connection.*`. Without it every `connect()` fails with
  `Request to own name refused by policy`; install the supplied template:

  ```sh
  sed "s/RUN_AS_USER/$USER/" dbus/dev.quick_blue.Connection.conf \
    | sudo tee /usr/share/dbus-1/system.d/dev.quick_blue.Connection.conf >/dev/null
  sudo systemctl reload dbus-broker   # or: sudo systemctl restart dbus
  ```

- `libbluetooth.so.3` (installed with BlueZ runtime libraries) for L2CAP
  sockets; `QuickBlue.capabilities().supportsL2capSockets` reports support
  regardless, and `openL2cap` fails with an error when the library is absent.

## Tests

```sh
flutter test
```

Hardware-backed BLE behaviour is covered by the example app's integration test
(the Linux package itself only exercises pure helpers):

```sh
cd ../quick_blue/example
QUICK_BLUE_HIDE_TEST_WINDOW=1 \
  xvfb-run -a flutter test integration_test/ble_smoke_test.dart -d linux
```
