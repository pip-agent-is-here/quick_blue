# Android companion association

Use `QuickBlue.companion` for Android companion-device association, not as a
replacement for normal BLE scanning or GATT ownership. Check `isSupported()`
before offering Android-only association UI. Support depends on OS capabilities.

Dart fragment in an async function:

```dart
if (await QuickBlue.companion.isSupported()) {
  final associations = await QuickBlue.companion.associations();
  print('associated devices: ${associations.length}');
}
```

The facade also exposes `associate(CompanionAssociationRequest(...))` and
`disassociate(associationId)`. Select request filters appropriate to your product;
an association does not replace `device.connect()` or permissions setup.
Dart method-channel tests verify result mapping, not the user's system picker on
hardware.[^source3]

## Version-sensitive BLE behavior

- API 26 is the plugin minimum.
- LE L2CAP requires API 29+.
- Native service-change callbacks require API 31+.
- Runtime scan/connect permission rules change at Android 12.
- Final-client disconnect reconciliation is Android-specific, not a universal
  platform guarantee.

See [platform setup](platform-setup.md), [pairing](pairing.md),
[connections](connections.md), and [capabilities](capabilities.md).
